Title: Analyze Bacterial Pangenomes in R with 'Pagoo'
Description: Provides an encapsulated, object-oriented class system for
  analyzing bacterial pangenomes. For a definition of this concept, see
  Tettelin, et al. (2005) <doi:10.1073/pnas.0506758102>. It uses the R6
  package as backend. It was designed in order to facilitate and speed-up
  the comparative analysis of multiple bacterial genomes, standardizing and
  optimizing routine tasks performed everyday. There are a handful of things
  done everyday when working with bacterial pangenomes: subset, summarize,
  extract, visualize and store data. So, 'pagoo' is intended to facilitate these
  tasks as much as possible. For a description of the implemented data structure
  and methods, see Ferres & Iraola (2020), <doi:10.1101/2020.07.29.226951>.
