Title: Pagoo: Analyze Bacterial Pangenomes in R
Description: pagoo is an encapsulated, object-oriented class system for 
  analyzing bacterial pangenomes. It uses the R6 package as backend. It was 
  designed in order to facilitate and speed-up the comparative analysis of 
  multiple bacterial genomes, standardizing and optimizing routine tasks 
  performed everyday. There are a handful of things done everyday when working 
  with bacterial pangenomes: subset, summarize, extract, visualize and store 
  data. So, pagoo is intended to facilitate these tasks as much as possible.
