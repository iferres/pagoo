# Pagoo: An encapsulated Object-Oriented framework for analyzing bacterial pangenomes in R

*"One object to store them all, one object to find them, one object to query from and with ggplot2 visualize them." (Lord Sauron)*

## Introduction

`pagoo` is an encapsulated, object-oriented class system for analyzing bacterial pangenomes. It uses the [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) package as backend. It was designed in order to facilitate and speed-up the comparative analysis of multiple bacterial genomes, standardizing and optimizing routine tasks performed everyday. There are a handful of things done everyday when working with bacterial pangenomes: subset, summarize, extract, visualize and store data. So, `pagoo` is intended to facilitate these tasks as much as possible. 


## Information and Tutorials

Please visit [pagoo webpage](https://iferres.github.io/pagoo/) for more resources.

## Installation

`pagoo` is available at CRAN:
```r
install.packages("pagoo")
```

Alternatively you can install the latest dev version from GitHub using `devtools`:
``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('iferres/pagoo')
```
