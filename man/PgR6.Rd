\section{Public Fields}{

\describe{
    \item{\bold{\code{$pan_matrix}}}{: The panmatrix. Rows are organisms, and
    columns are groups of orthologous. Cells indicates the presence (>=1) or
    absence (0) of a given gene, in a given organism. Cells can have values
    greater than 1 if contain in-paralogs.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$organisms}}}{: A \code{\link[S4Vectors:DataFrame-class]{DataFrame}} with available
    organism names, and organism number identifier as \code{rownames()}. (Dropped
    organisms will not be displayed in this field, see \code{$dropped} below).
    Additional metadata will be shown if provided, as additional columns.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$clusters}}}{: A \code{\link[S4Vectors:DataFrame-class]{DataFrame}} with the groups
    of orthologous (clusters). Additional metadata will be shown as additional columns,
    if provided before. Each row corresponds to each cluster.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$genes}}}{: A \code{\link[IRanges:DataFrameList-class]{SplitDataFrameList}} object with
    one entry per cluster. Each element contains a \code{\link[S4Vectors:DataFrame-class]{DataFrame}}
    with gene ids (\code{<gid>}) and additional metadata, if provided. \code{gid} are
    created by \code{paste}ing organism and gene names, so duplication in gene names
    are avoided.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$core_level}}}{: The percentage of organisms a gene must be in
    to be considered as part of the coregenome. \code{core_level = 95} by default.
    Can't be set above 100, and below 85 raises a warning.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$core_genes}}}{: Like \code{genes}, but only showing core genes.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$core_clusters}}}{: Like \code{$clusters}, but only showing core
    clusters.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$cloud_genes}}}{: Like \code{genes}, but only showing cloud genes.
    These are defined as those clusters which contain a single gene (singletons), plus
    those which have more than one but its organisms are probably clonal due to identical
    general gene content. Colloquially defined as strain-specific genes.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$cloud_clusters}}}{: Like \code{$clusters}, but only showing cloud
    clusters as defined above.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$shell_genes}}}{: Like \code{genes}, but only showing shell genes.
    These are defined as those clusters than don't belong nethier to the core genome,
    nor to cloud genome. Colloquially defined as genes that are present in some but not
    all strains, and that aren't strain-specific.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$shell_clusters}}}{: Like \code{$clusters}, but only showing shell
    clusters, as defined above.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$summary_stats}}}{: A \code{\link[S4Vectors:DataFrame-class]{DataFrame}} with
    information about the number of core, shell, and cloud clusters, as well as the
    total number of clusters.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$random_seed}}}{: The last \code{.Random.seed}. Used for
    reproducibility purposes only.}
    \item{\bold{\code{$dropped}}}{: A \code{character} vector with dropped organism
    names, and organism number identifier as \code{names()}}
